* As of oVirt v4.1.0 a bug was introduced that makes the session token
  expire and not renew even if using the Python-SDK. That makes the
  oVirt storage balancer fail when run in daemon mode after cca. 30
  minutes of execution, receiving a 401 HTTP code from oVirt, as the
  project uses the same ovirtsdk4.Connection object all the time.

  This bug has already been reported on oVirt's BZ and it can be tracked
  in this URL: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1434830

  Seems this will be fixed in 4.1.2.
